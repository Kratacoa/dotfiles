# emacs
- Figure out how to make `word-wrap` and `toggle-truncate-lines` in `init.el` actually work

# st
- Figure out how to properly manage `config.h`; so far I configured it with [flexibeast's guide](https://github.com/flexibeast/guides/blob/master/suckless.md#configuring), but I would like to slim the repository and manage them properly with `stow`
- Figure out why it adds these ugly borders with even pixelsizes
- Follow the [BGRA glyphs and scaling merge request](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxft/-/merge_requests/1) for.. colored emoji!

# tmux
- Fix copypasting
- Make tmux redraw the screen upon the switch into a window, it messes it up sometimes (or maybe it's st?)
- Add either the `nord` or `gruvbox` colorschemes
- Improve the visual feedback of focused pane
- Make the next pane in a window open in the same directory
- Write a cron job for `$WEATHER` environment variable, so that it won't appear all broken on my status bar when internet is off
