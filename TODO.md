# general
- perhaps separate these entries into README files of respective directories

# weechat
- Figure out what to insert of the `weechat`'s folder
 
# zathura
- my syntax doesn't do shit

# tmux
- Make it represent colors properly
 
# emacs
- Figure out how to make `word-wrap` and `toggle-truncate-lines` work always

# polybar
- Change the theme
- Make the modules fit properly on the bar (central mpd isn't as centered as I would like)
- Make backlight and volume modules bars interactive
- Make the other modules interactive too by implementing popups that show more information
- Substitute underlines with some separators between the various modules

# kakoune
## Do 
- Get an okay colorscheme
- Add fuzzy searching and completion for `:e` command and similar
- Improve markdown syntax highlighting, implement opening links within kakoune if it's local and the browser if it's a hyperlink
- Get some decent insert mode mappings, like `Ctrl-w` for deleting words etc.
- Check if there is a plugin or some code to make allineated comments on the side
## Reconsider
- use standard mappings from Kakoune's wiki instead of `kakboard`
